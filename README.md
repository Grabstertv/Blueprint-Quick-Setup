# Overview
Update or set up the base [Blueprint Dashboard](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/Blueprint) with easy to follow instructions.

**This obviously does not cover everything** so things like adding app icon will need to be done manually. This should only be used for recreating the dashboard for an update or for first time setup to save time on the boring stuff for example.

### Use at your own risk.

# Usage
- Install the latest python for your system.
